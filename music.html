    <h1>Music</h1>
    <p>Music is mesmerizing. Music plays different roles in everyone’s life, I treat music a bit differently as compared to others. I can’t work, run, travel or read while listening to music nor can I listen to music while doing any of those things. It’s not like I do nothing and sit down to listen to some music (well, I do it sometimes), it’s just that I do very light things which requires significantly lesser attention like sipping tea, arranging some laundry, cooking, bathing etc. so that I can listen to songs single-mindedly. Music is really important to me, it reboots my mind, it’s the only thing that has the ability to transform my mood (positively, of course). You know I have tried to do various things that people do related to music, they listen while running, working out, while doing some writing work, while cycling and what not. I tried those things because I thought maybe I am wrong somewhere, maybe it’s more fun than I think it will be, but it turned out to be lame, seriously guys it takes the fun out of both the activities, music and the other thing which you are doing, or pretending to do. Some of them listen to music while reading books!! What the fuckk, I mean how can one possibly read something while someone is singing, I really don’t have the ability to enjoy the essence of reading books (which I love as much as I love music) and music at the same time. You know what I believe is that most of the people are just pretending to do things, just for the sake of it. Like nowadays it’s a fashion to put on your earphones and start running or working out, someone working out without an earphone looks different, you know the reason behind it is not the love for music, it is because people can’t really focus on one thing, and their attention span has become really short. Let me explain for example if I have to go to gym from my home and it’s a 10 minute walk, what will I do while walking, I will have to listen to some music otherwise I will get bored, or sometimes even people are driven out of their home because of the fact that they will listen to some music, they are motivated by music and not by the exercise, which is wrong, if some day your phone is not charged, you don’t have a pair earphones, maybe you will not wish to workout. I know I am talking very extreme, but seriously guys trust me, focus on the activity, your driving force should be the activity that you do not music, or anything else. Try running in an open ground without listening to any music, trust me you will get my point, and for that sake even try listening to music while just doing nothing, you will surely understand how you were destroying the core essence of music while diluting it with some other activity. 
Just enjoy the things you do. Be positive and keep pushing.</p>
