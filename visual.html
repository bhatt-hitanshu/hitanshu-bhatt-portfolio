    <h1>Visual's Power in a movie</h1>
    <p>I was just watching Baahubali: the conclusion, it’s not like I haven’t watched it it’s just that it was on T.V today so I just came across it and like any one of S.S Rajamouli’s audiences I am always amazed by his work. I mean his imagination, his ideas are just something else. This kind of combination of magnanimity and creativity with a perfect blend of light hearted moments and a pinch of fun in portraying something set in an ancient Indian backdrop can be seen only in his movies apart from Amish’s novels. I have not seen any other Indian or international filmmaker or writer acing this particular genre better than them in their respective fields. But you know still I would say that Amish’s novels are much more smooth flowing. But in case of Rajamouli he has to be strongly visual and it’s really difficult to create something visually magnanimous and please a major chunk of audience. I am not saying that it is easier to write, writing it is equally difficult if someone can’t build the images in his/her head then bringing it to life is not really possible. But even after writing brilliantly you can easily mess up in the visual form (as it happens with most of the movies inspired by novels, just because filmmakers can’t keep up with the brilliance that is built by author in its readers.). Yeah so I was just watching this movie and I was wondering what is it that could have been a step ahead I mean I am no one to judge baahubali, it’s a film loved by millions including me but still there are some typical things which are maybe because of translation in Hindi. But despite of a bit of trash dialogue deliveries, and I am saying bit, the film is still great because its core, the script and concept and screenplay and direction is engaging enough and is brilliant. So that’s what’s the point is if your content is strong enough if you are believing in the process and you are honest and organic about the thing you are doing the end result is going to be exactly as you imagined of it.</p>
