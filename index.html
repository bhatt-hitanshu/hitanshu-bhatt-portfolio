        <div class="container container-centre"><h3>Acting</h3>
        <p>I am a movie freak since my childhood, and everything that I do has started because of my love for cinema and the craft of acting. I figured out if I have to act i will have to write something myself, and thus fell in love with writing, then to upload the videos on my channel I had to learn editing, so all and all I want to say that everything that I do is around acting, 'cause that's where it all started from. You can check my work on my youtube channel, and you can also subscribe if you wish to stay updated on my new projects. I also sometimes write about movies and stuff, do read if it interests you in the Blogs section</p><a class="link link-primary" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-spLl0fXRsSuIndxrEfXhA">YOUTUBE</a> <a class="link link-secondary" href="/">Blogs</a>
