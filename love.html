    <h1>Love</h1>
    <p>The moment we read this word there is feeling of blood rush starting from the stomach reaching to the heart with an image in our head. The picture which we can never forget, even if we try to. 
        Do you remember the first time you fell in love? Even while writing this I can recall that particular moment. I can feel the excitement which I felt at that time. Was it a particular point of time? Not necessarily, sometimes this feeling takes time to develop. But as soon as our conscience discovers it there comes a broad smile. You know that feeling when you are smiling and the person sitting in front of you doesn’t even gets a hint of your feeling because you are sitting with no expressions on your face? Yes, it’s because you are smiling in your mind.
        You know the best thing about love is that it is harmless in its pure state. Yes, if are you are manipulating your mind and convincing yourself that you love that person then it may have its negatives. But we are not here to talk about negatives. I always feel that love is the most motivating factor, which can divert your energy in many productive areas. When we are attracted to someone we are insanely desperate to impress that person even if we don’t know what would impress her/him. We just try and incorporate all the good habits thinking that it would work. Most of the times what I used to do was just imagining all the ideal situations and each and every time these stories used to have the same ending (needless to mention the ending). I knew that these tales can never be true but still it felt amazing. When you are in love there is no saturation point. You are always happy and excited out of no particular reason. 
        In the end I would just say that if you haven’t yet experienced these feelings trust me it’s the most beautiful feeling in the world and don’t try to feel like this, it will happen and let it happen naturally don’t try to create this feeling synthetically. Remember, “You never search love, you find it”.
